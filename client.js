// I'm absolutely thrilled that I was able to make this work on my second edit.
// First, I had the console.log statements in the function, which was returning
// the correct output, spaced by three undefined statements.  On my second edit,
// I removed all console.log from the function.

// And now I got the Pro Mode to work!!  And it's only 9:23 PM!!

console.log(whichIsBigger(3, 2));
console.log(whichIsBigger(2, 7));
console.log(whichIsBigger(7, 7));

console.log(whichIsBigger('taco 86.7', 41));  // having trouble getting this last one to work.
